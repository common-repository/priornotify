== Description ==

**PriorNotify is rocket fuel for your food business!**

PriorNotify automates the FDA "prior notice" process that is required to sell and ship food and drink products to customers in the USA.

PriorNotify opens up the USA market, and allows many different kinds of businesses to easily sell and ship food and drink products to USA customers:

With our app, you can process a single prior notice in a few seconds, or multiple prior notices at the same time.  The automation also allows you to process hundreds or even thousands of prior notices in a single day.

Our PriorNotify plugin is easy to use, and gets you set up quickly.
